<b><h1>Pokemon Card Generator</h1></b>


This is an application that a user can type in the name of a pokemon and the app will generate a cool pokemon card for the user to see, along with the pokemons stats! It looks like a pokemon card you would get from a pack :)



How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PokeAPI


I started with a JavaScript fetch api, calling from PokeAPI. I sifted through the data I received and was able to put all of the data I wanted into a compact pokemon card. <b>The card's background color also changes depending on the pokemon's type!</b>
